# The Problem
Due to rising international tourism and westernization, people tend to buy imported products. This affects our country's GDP in a negative way. A probable solution to this is to use local products. Rural India is a hidden gem. Most of these imported artificats are made by Indians and sold at affordable prices by the locals. Only bottleneck is people aren't much aware of this.

# The Solution
Our website Roots of India, which:
- Creates awarness about rural tourism in India
- Promotes use and buying of handmade art and crafts made by the local skilled-people of India
- Provides employment opportunities to the local residents of rural areas

# Technologies used:
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- MongoDB
- Node JS
- Express JS
- Axios
- Node package manager (npm)

# Challenges we ran into
- Making site responsive: Solved using tailwind css utilities
- Allocation of specific tour guide: Solved using pincode matching in Backend
